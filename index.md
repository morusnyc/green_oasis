Green Oasis Community Garden was started by life partners Norman Vallee and Reinaldo Arana in 1981 in response to the City of New York’s and the landlords’ of the Lower East Side neglect of the neighborhood. Green Oasis Community Garden and Gilbert’s Sculpture Garden officially merged in 1997. Today the garden stands in lots 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 of block 317 on 8th street between Avenues C and D. What started as a grassroots effort to improve the neighborhood, burgeoned into a space for gardening, arts, and community activism. The archives were created by longtime garden member/artist Sur Rodney Sur.

The Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS) is dedicated to preserving the history of grassroots activism on the Lower East Side. The following documents represent a selection from the Green Oasis Community Garden/Gilbert's Sculpture Garden Records held in the MoRUS archives.
